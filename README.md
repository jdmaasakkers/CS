# Image Recognition via TensorFlow, optimized by MPI

A number of task have been defined to start of the project:
- Get TensorFlow to work on Odyssey.
- Get The Distributed version of TensorFlow to work on Odyssey GPUs.
- Implement our own set of photos. This includes parallelized pre-processing which will prepare the photos bto be used as input for the model.
- Attempt to parallelize with MPI.
- Run a parallel version of TensorFlow with our own photos and setup a way in which new photos can be analyzed quickly.
